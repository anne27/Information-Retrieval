# Query OptimizationQ

We use Tf-Idf based vector space document retrieval to get top 10 documents based on a cosine similarity between query and document vector. Further, we provide a client for a user to give Relevance Feedback (tell which all docs are relevant and which are irrelevant). \

We optimize the query using Rocchio's Algorithm, and keep doing this process of taking user feedback and updating the query vector until the user quits the program.\
For simplicity, we use only `comp.graphics` and `rec.motorcycles` documents.

## Description

The vector space model implemented in the previous assignment (containing vector representations of documents and query vectors) is used to compute similarity between query and docs, and retrieve top-k documents. The user is asked to select relevant docs, and the query vector is modified through Rocchioâ€™s algorithm.\

`q(modified) = alpha*q(original) + beta*centroid(relevant) - gamma*centroid(non-relevant)`\
alpha = 1\
beta = 0.75\
gamma = 0.15

## Running the Code
Run `rocchio.py`.
